        initial yawn, and it is called <b>4 </b>______ pattern. It is similar
        to a <b>5 </b>______ effect.</p>
    <p>The second is known as the <b>6 </b>______ effect. It states that people
        imitate each other’s behaviour without knowing it. This behaviour might be possible due to
        <b>7 </b>______ which are also
        important for learning.</p>
    <p>The third one is called the&nbsp; <b>8 </b>______. Scientists set up an
        experiment to prove that <b>9 </b>______ would yawn at the sound of
        yawning and they also discovered that we yawn more frequently at the yawns of
        <b>10 </b>______> rather than
        strangers.</p>
